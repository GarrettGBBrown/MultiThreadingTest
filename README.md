# MultiThreadingTest
An example project for demonstrating Multithreading with file input.

This project was completed during Assignment 6 of Operating Systems. This is an example as to how to use parallel processes to increase throughput for a large amounts of data.

The goal of this project was to learn how to use multithreading in a way it could be applied to other applications.


## Credits
- Credit to Dr. Alnaeli for templete starter files for non-parallel java process.

## Installation
-Project needs to have java compiled for class files
- For either c++ or java, there needs to be a accounts.txt file. The java code has a function to create one and populate it. I have a file for it but at 4 million accounts the file can't be uploaded to github.

## Bugs
- C++ time recording only works in linux, not quite sure why.
